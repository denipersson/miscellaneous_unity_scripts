# miscellaneous_unity_scripts
Independent scripts that work on their own without being reliant on anything else

For clarification: none of the scripts here are parts of a whole. They all do one specific thing and are as plug as play as it gets.

Simply assign the desired script to the desired game object, feel free to use for any purpose as long as you give me credit.
